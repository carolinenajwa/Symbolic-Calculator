Program 4 - A Symbolic Algebra Calculator <br/>


This program implements a symbolic algebra calculator, which is a more complex calculator than the standard calculators.
The following are some of the key features of the symbolic calculator: <br/>
•	It can use variables<br/>
•	It stores the structure of the expressions entered<br/>
•	It can evaluate expressions and sub-expressions by substituting the variables with their associated values<br/>
•	It can perform transformations on expressions<br/>
The program will read algebraic expressions and attempt to solve them. Objectives to this program includes:<br/>
•	To have an in-depth understanding of the tree data structures and their respective algorithms<br/>
•	To understand and make use of basic input parsing by use of tokens<br/>
